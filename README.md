## Environment Setup

### Create a Virtual Environment
Open a terminal in your project folder and run:

```bash
# For Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
### Install Required Packages
```bash
# Make sure you have pip installed
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Install Jupyter Notebook
This project uses **Python + Jupyter Notebooks** in **VS Code**. Here's how to set it up step-by-step:

1. Search "jupyter" and install the Python extension for VS Code (by Microsoft)

2. Open the folder containing this project

3. Make sure your virtual environment is selected (Command Palette → Python: Select Interpreter)

4. Open the data_visualization.ipynb file or create a new Jupyter Notebook

5. Follow along as we demonstrate data processing and visualization techniques!
